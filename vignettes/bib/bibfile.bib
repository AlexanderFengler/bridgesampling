	Abstract = {Direct search methods are best known as unconstrained optimization techniques that do not explicitly use derivatives. Direct search methods were formally proposed and widely applied in the 1960s but fell out of favor with the mathematical optimization community by the early 1970s because they lacked coherent mathematical analysis. Nonetheless, users remained loyal to these methods, most of which were easy to program, some of which were reliable. In the past fifteen years, these methods have seen a revival due, in part, to the appearance of mathematical analysis, as well as to interest in parallel and distributed computing. This review begins by briefly summarizing the history of direct search methods and considering the special properties of problems for which they are well suited. Our focus then turns to a broad class of methods for which we provide a unifying framework that lends itself to a variety of convergence results. The underlying principles allow generalization to handle bound constraints and linear constraints. We also discuss extensions to problems with nonlinear constraints.},

@article{OCarroll200374,
	Abstract = {Objectives: Damasio has proposed an influential model of human decision making---the Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH), where he argues that somatic feedback to the brain influences decision making in humans. It is proposed that when choosing between options that differ in relative risk, a somatic marker (for example, a ``gut feeling'') feeds back to the brain and influences cognitive appraisal. This study tested the hypothesis that the noradrenergic system may play a part in this afferent feedback process.Methods: Thirty healthy young adults were randomly allocated to receive placebo, 4 mg, or 8 mg reboxetine (a new selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor that acts to increase central noradrenergic activity). It is hypothesised that enhancement of central noradrenergic activity may amplify the effect of afferent feedback, and lead to altered decision making. All subjects completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a computerised card playing game where the player is instructed to try and win as much money as possible over 100 selections from one of four decks.Results: There were no significant differences between the three groups in gambling task performance.Conclusion: This result suggests that central noradrenergic activity may not be critically involved in the afferent feedback mechanism that is central to the somatic marker hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Deciding advantageously in a complex situation is thought to require
	overt reasoning on declarative knowledge, namely, on facts pertaining
	to premises, options for action, and outcomes of actions that embody
	the pertinent previous experience. An alternative possibility was
	investigated: that overt reasoning is preceded by a nonconscious
	biasing step that uses neural systems other than those that support
	declarative knowledge. Normal participants and patients with prefrontal
	damage and decision-making defects performed a gambling task in which
	behavioral, psychophysiological, and self-account measures were obtained
	in parallel. Normals began to choose advantageously before they realized
	which strategy worked best, whereas prefrontal patients continued
	to choose disadvantageously even after they knew the correct strategy.
	Moreover, normals began to generate anticipatory skin conductance
	responses (SCRs) whenever they pondered a choice that turned out
	to be risky, before they knew explicitly that it was a risky choice,
	whereas patients never developed anticipatory SCRs, although some
	eventually realized which choices were risky. The results suggest
	that, in normal individuals, nonconscious biases guide behavior before
	conscious knowledge does. Without the help of such biases, overt
	knowledge may be insufficient to ensure advantageous behavior.},

@article{Lev200840,
	Abstract = {Traffic offences present danger to the offender, and to others. This
	study examines differences in decision making and personality between
	traffic offenders and non-offenders. Fifty-one traffic offenders
	participating in penalty courses were compared to a control group
	of 36 drivers who were not penalized for traffic offences in the
	5 years prior to the study. All participants performed the Iowa Gambling
	Task (IGT), a popular decision task employed for assessing cognitive
	impulsivity, and completed the "big five" personality questionnaire.
	The results showed that traffic offenders made fewer advantageous
	choices on the IGT; and an analysis with a formal cognitive model,
	the Expectancy Valance model, suggests that this results from offenders'
	high weighting of gains compared to losses. An examination of personality
	factors reveals that traffic offenders were more extraverted. The
	predictive power of IGT performance was comparable to that of the
	personality factor. These results demonstrate that the IGT can be
	useful for studying individual differences in risk taking in a real-world
	task, and combined with the EV model, identify the sources of these
	differences. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
