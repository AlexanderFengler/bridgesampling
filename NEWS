                    Changes in bridgesampling Version 0.2-x
                    Released XXX 2017

  Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

  o Added stan_bridge_sampler(), which allows one to obtain the marginal 
    likelihood directly from a fitted stanfit object that contains posterior 
    samples. Note that it may be necessary to compile a new stanfit object 
    without samples if the one with samples was compiled in a different 
    session/pc. See new vignettes for examples.
    
  o Added repetitions argument to bridge sampler functions which allows to
    compute independent bridge sample estimates (based on the same posterior
    samples). bridge_sampler() now returns object of class "bridge" for 
    calculations with repetitions = 1, but an object of class "bridge_list" if
    repetitions > 1, the latter contains the full list of estimates (but no q 
    vectors). 
  
  o renamed compute_post_prob() to post_prob(), which is now a generic function.
  
  o added new generic function logml() which returns 
    
  o Multicore computations (i.e., cors > 1) on Unix-like systen (e.g., Mac OS, 
    Linux) are now performed with forking via parallel::mcapply().
  
  Bugfixes

  o compute_post_prob() now works even when exp(logml) initially returns Inf
    (solution works via brobdingnag).
    
  o Bridge sampler more robust due to various small improvements and produces
    more informative error messages should it fail. 
    
  o If log_prob() returns NA, these values are replaced with -Inf on the log 
    scale (which assumes a likelihood of 0). With warning.
