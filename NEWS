                    Changes in bridgesampling Version 0.2-x
                    Released XXX 2017

  Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

  o Added stan_bridge_sampling(), which allows to obtain the marginal likelihood
    directly from a fitted stanfit object that contains posterior samples. Note 
    that it may be necessary to compile a new stanfit object without samples 
    if the one with samples was compiled in a different session/pc. See new 
    vignettes for examples.
    
  o Multicore computations (i.e., cors > 1) on Unix-like systen (e.g., Mac OS, 
    Linux) are now performed with forking via parallel::mcapply().
  
  Bugfixes

  o compute_post_prob() now works even when exp(logml) initially returns Inf
    (solution works via brobdingnag).
    
  o Bridge sampler more robust due to various small improvements and produces
    more informative error messages should it fail. 
    
  o If log_prob() returns NA, these values are replaced with -Inf on the log 
    scale (which assumes a likelihood of 0). With warning.
